            <h1>Our Story: Building Hope Since 2021</h1>
            <p>RiseUp Youth Foundation emerged from a simple but powerful realization: every young South African deserves the opportunity to rise above their circumstances and build a future filled with promise and purpose.</p>

            <h2>From Vision to Impact: Our Journey</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
                <div class="history-text">
                    <p>Founded in 2021 during the challenging aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, RiseUp Youth Foundation began as a grassroots initiative in Durban, South Africa. Our founders, educators, and community leaders witnessed firsthand how the pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities, particularly affecting youth from marginalized communities.</p>
                    
                    <p>What started as weekend mentorship sessions for 15 young people has grown into a comprehensive youth empowerment organization reaching hundreds annually across KwaZulu-Natal. Our growth has been guided by listening to the needs of the communities we serve and adapting our programs to address the most pressing challenges facing South African youth today.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2022, we expanded our Digital Skills Academy in response to the growing digital divide. By 2023, we had established partnerships with local businesses and tech companies, creating pathways to employment for our graduates. Today, we operate multiple community centers and have launched satellite programs in three additional provinces.</p>

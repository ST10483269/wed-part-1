                        <p>Andile joined our Digital Skills Academy with no prior computer experience. Growing up in a township with limited resources, he saw technology as something distant and inaccessible. Through our program, he discovered a passion for web development.</p>
                        <p>"The first time I created a website that actually worked, I couldn't believe it was me who built it," Andile recalls. "The facilitators saw potential in me that I didn't see in myself."</p>
                        <p>After graduating, Andile secured an internship and is now employed as a junior web developer. He recently returned to RiseUp as a volunteer mentor, helping other youth discover their potential.</p>
                        <blockquote>"RiseUp didn't just teach me to code—they taught me to believe in what I could become."</blockquote>
